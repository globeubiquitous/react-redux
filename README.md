# Toptal Test

### Task
* User must be able to create an account and log in.
* When logged in, a user can see, edit and delete his times he entered.
* Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
* Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time.
* When displayed, each time entry has average speed.
* Filter by dates from-to.
* Report on average speed & distance per week.
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication
* In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
* All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed. You will not be marked on graphic design. However, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
* Bonus: unit and e2e tests.
